* Discussed DT collaboration with a number of stakeholders at Isola 2021
* Struggleling with completing a Doctoral Network application about Digital Twins to deadline in November

#### Jim Woodcock
* We now have a working prototype generating verified animations from within Isabelle using the Iteraction Tree work (see https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05133). I'm now including this in the Isabelle course I'm developing. I also intend to use it to code up an animation for angelic nondeterminism for an abstract specification of roll back and adaptive steps in FMI master algorithms.

#### Nick Battle
* Assist Leo with his VDMJ plugin implementation of an Isabelle translation of VDM-SL.
* Attend Overture-19 :-)
* Talk to Claudio and Simon about the detail of the formal model of clocks in FMI3.


#### Hugo Daniel Macedo
    * Organized OVT-19.
    * Working with Christian Lillelund on a paper on DT for water based on DTU’s open dataset from Belinde region mentioned in one of the Live from Behind the Walls…

#### Mirgita Frasheri
* worked on the rabbitmq fmu, adding an enable/disable input, as well as fixing issues.
* some work on the fm tutorial demo.
* started with some basic script for scenario generation for instantiating a simulation with multiple robots in gazebo.
* presented at the ovt workshop, and orbitlab event.
* continued work on the agent papers, there seems to be a bug wrt random number generation in the simulator, so this is more or less stalled, waiting for input from the developers.
* progressed on the osmc with Casper and Henrik, we have all the pieces now, and are ready for tests.

#### Frederik Madsen
* Working on dtp view in Into-cps application.
* Working on integrating the view with DTP tooling server.

#### Casper Thule
* organized OVT-19
* OSMC example - making getmaxstepsize explicit in MaBL
* rabbitmq fmu static compilation issues on WIndows
* Digital Twin UI into-cps application
* Model-Swapping in co-simulation
* Progress on 2 possible IFD applications
* FMI3 native support
* Attempt to replace JNI with Java17 incubator project 
* First meeting in programming languages theme and two talks already scheduled
